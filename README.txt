Final project for CSCI 1300
It can be found on github at with https://github.com/ColeVerc/CSCI-1300-Final-Project.git

All filed should be in the same folder and can be compiled with:
g++ -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic -std=c++17 "main.cpp"

With prepping for finals and this not being the most important proejct for me grade wise, I wasnt able to implement everything that was asked for on the PDF.
This includes:
    The DNA RNA Tasks
    Advisors providing help
    The random events
I was still able to add the different tiles having function when landing on them, but i just gave and took away different stat points and discoveryPoints

There were many also ideas I had that I couldnt fit in like:
- Different attributes that could
- change you minimum/maximum role
- change the number of wheel spins you can do in a turn
- multipliers on points
- potentially the game ending when the first person makes it to the confernce
