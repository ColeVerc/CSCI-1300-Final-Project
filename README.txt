Final project for CSCI 1300

With prepping for finals and this not being the most important proejct for me, I wasnt able to implament everything that was asked for on the PDF.
This includes:
    The DNA RNA Tasks

There were many also ideas I had that I couldnt fit in like:
- Different attributes that could
- change you minimum/maximum role
- change the number of wheel spins you can do in a turn
- multipliers on points
- potentially the game ending when the first person makes it to the confernce
